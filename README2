The first thing you need to do is authenticate against google base, the 
authentication token returned will be stored in the database and can be 
revoked by pressing the "revoke authentication" button.

The following configurable options are available:
"Enable Google Base": Whether to enable the module or not.
"Limit for the number of products to upload at once": This option controls how 
		many products to upload on each "batch". After pressing upload this many 
		products will be uploaded and you'll have to press the button again to 
		upload the rest of the products (it will resume from the last product
		uploaded).
"Author name for submitted products": The author name shown in the google base
		page for the product.
"Author email for submitted products": The author email shown the google base
		page for the product.
"Submit products as draft": If checked the products will be submitted as drafts,
		which means you'll have to login to your google base dashboard and set them 
		as published manually. Use this at first to test if everything is working 
		properly.
"Submit upc and/or isbn": If you have a module installed which allows you to 
		specify upc and isbn for your products this option will add them to your
		products attributes. NOTE: the module must place the upc and isbn in the 
		"products" table of your database with column names "products_upc" and 
		"products_isbn".
